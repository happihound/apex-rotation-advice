#apex legends poi names on the map worlds edge
#the format is 
#(int),(string),(int),(int),(int),(bool)
#poiID, poiName, x, y, radius, isChoke

#example POI:
6,Trials,763,753,160,False

#Chokes are all paths between POIs, they dont have a radius
#All chokes are named "{name - name} choke", everything else is a poi

#example choke:
1,North Trails Choke, 920,630,-1,True

#After all the poi's and chokes we place an ASSOCIATION to tell the program that we are switching to assosiations
#assosiations look like this:
#(int),(int)...(int)
#poiID,{other poi or choke},...,{other poi or choke}
