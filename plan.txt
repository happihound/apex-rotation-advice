Convert the image to convert to 1:1 aspect ratio and then to 800x800 pixels
Take the input image and do threshholding on it to highlight enemy markers
If the markers are close enough, group them together and find the center of the group
Draw a minimum convex hull around the center of the group, 1.5x the distance between the furthest markers
Find the ring, and designate it as the desination point
Use the image of the base map to plot a path between the hulls and the unplayable area, to the last ring pull
